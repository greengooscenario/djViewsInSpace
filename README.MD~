 
djViewsInSpace is a basic django-based web app that allows users to upload images and have them evaluated by EXIF extraction and optical character recognition.
 
It was developed as a companion program to phpMarkerBase to populate the database that web app depends on. Its use cases however go far beyond that: djViewsInSpace can easily be adapted to all scenarios where Images or other files are being collected, especially in a collaborative manner, and subsequently are to be automatically evaluated -- with optional curation by the uploading user or an admin.

## Test run
Run 'python manage.py runserver 60000' in the djViewsInSpace directory to launch a test server. You will then find the web app at http://localhost:60000/ . Refer to django documentation on how to set up a production server.

## Admin
This distribution is configured for an admin called "admin" with the password "admin". You can change this in the administration interface http://localhost:60000/admin/ .
